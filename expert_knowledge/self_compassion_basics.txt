Title: Self-Compassion Basics

Developed by Dr. Kristin Neff, self-compassion includes:
1. Self-kindness: Being gentle with yourself in times of failure.
2. Common humanity: Recognizing that suffering is part of shared human experience.
3. Mindfulness: Observing negative thoughts without judgment.

Practice: "This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is part of life. May I be kind to myself in this moment."
