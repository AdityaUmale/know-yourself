Title: Common Cognitive Distortions

1. All-or-Nothing Thinking: Seeing things in black-and-white. Example: "If I fail this test, I’m a failure."
2. Catastrophizing: Expecting the worst. Example: "If I make a mistake, I’ll lose everything."
3. Mind Reading: Assuming you know what others think. Example: "She didn’t smile, so she must hate me."
4. Overgeneralization: Seeing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern. 
5. Mental Filtering: Focusing only on the negatives and ignoring positives.

CBT encourages identifying, challenging, and reframing these thoughts.
